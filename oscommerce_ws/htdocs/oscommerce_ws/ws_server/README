OSCommerce interface and Dolibarr
---------------------------------

TODO ON THE OSCOMMERCE WEBSITE INSTALLATION :

Copy the directory ws_server and its content on the OSCommerce web server.
This includes the lib directory which contains the nusoap library, the 
includes directory which contains the configure.php file and the ws_* files.

Configuration :
Everything is located into the configure.php in the form of define() calls 
(access to the database and default language definition)

That's it.
Your OSCommerce application now offers web services usable by other 
applications (like Dolibarr).

TEST THE INSTALLATION

Open the ws_index.html page on your OSCommerce server.
The links access several methods of the webservices.

If you obtain a "Fault" response, there is a problem (in general, the message 
gives you a way to find out which kind of problem).

TEST FROM DOLIBARR

The integration from Dolibarr is available from the CVS

An OSCommerce shop is provided here: http://osc.tiaris.info for you to test.
You can create clients, orders, ... This will make it all more realistic and 
will not cost you a penny, although you won't get anything out of it either!
